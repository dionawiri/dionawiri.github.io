          <p>
            NEW YORK (September 14th, 2021) — <a href="#">Edible Schoolyard NYC</a> (ESYNYC) announces its new Executive Director, Shanon Morris, MS, RD, CDN. Named by Hunter College as one of 40 under 40 rising stars in New York City food
            policy in 2020, Shanon has been working with communities to make nutrition relatable, accessible, and enjoyable for all.
          </p>

          <p>
            “We are thrilled to have Shanon join the Edible Schoolyard NYC team and lead our organization in its next chapter and impact,” said John S. Lyons, Chair of the Edible Schoolyard NYC Board of Directors. “Shanon brings expertise
            and a deep commitment to children, community health, and food equity. Our staff and Board are eager to partner with her in our efforts to support edible education for all NYC public school students and work towards a more just
            and sustainable food system for all — work we know is especially important given the devastating effects of COVID-19. We’re also grateful to Kate Brashares for her nine years of service as our Executive Director and partnership
            in ensuring a smooth leadership transition.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to align my passion in nutrition and health equity with Edible Schoolyard NYC’s mission to bring edible education to all New York City public school students. To help shape our community’s
            relationship with food through hands-on cooking and gardening education is what genuinely makes me excited to go to work every day,” said Shanon Morris. “As we enter a new school year amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, I know
            that our students’ health, learning, and social-emotional needs have increased, and so must our commitment. I’m ready to listen, learn and lead to ensure Edible Schoolyard NYC is as impactful as it can be during this critical
            moment and for many years to come.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Shanon is a proud alumna of Howard University and Columbia University, where she studied both Nutrition and Exercise Science. Most recently, Shanon served as the American Heart Association’s Senior Director of Community Impact
            where she focused on health equity and sustainable changes within communities with a concentration in food and nutrition security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shanon is also the author of MC Veggie Rocks the Mic, a children’s book that mixes nutrition and hip-hop to make learning about food, healthy habits, and cooking fun. She regularly contributes her expertise to the field as a
            guest lecturer, speaker, and writer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Edible Schoolyard NYC’s (ESYNYC) mission is to support edible education for every child in New York City. Founded in 2010, ESYNYC partners with NYC public schools, particularly those in underserved NYC communities
            disproportionately affected by food system inequities. Together with schools and community partners, ESYNYC seeks to cultivate healthy students and communities through hands-on cooking and gardening education, transforming
            children’s relationship with food and promoting healthier school environments. In the 2020-21 school year, ESYNYC worked with seven schools, serving 2,895 students from PreK to 8th grade in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. In
            addition to hands-on work within public schools, ESYNYC is also committed to providing professional development, resources, tools to support other educators throughout New York City in providing edible education.
